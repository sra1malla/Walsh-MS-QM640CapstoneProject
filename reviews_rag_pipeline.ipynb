      "3. **Complex Processes**: Sending money requires adding a beneficiary with extensive details and navigating through cumbersome steps.\n",
      "4. **Inconvenient Security Measures**: Face checking is required, which can be inconvenient without proper lighting.\n",
      "5. **Limited Transaction History**: Only a few recent transactions are available, and the transaction filter has been non-functional for months.\n",
      "6. **Technical Issues**: The app frequently crashes or freezes, and there are issues with fingerprint ID and mobile number registration errors.\n",

      "Expected: semantic, Detected: semantic, Latency: 4.00s\n",
      "Result: The feedback on multi-factor authentication highlights several concerns and suggestions for improvement. Users find the current security measures to be excessive and cumbersome, with too many steps required for login, such as needing a password, SMS OTP, and email OTP. This three-step process is particularly inconvenient when traveling or not using a local phone number. There is a preference for simpler, more efficient security methods, such as a combination of PIN or OTP, and a desire for biometric options like fingerprint authentication. Users also express concerns about the reliability of receiving OTPs, especially via mobile, and the lack of transparency regarding certain security features like Smartpass. Overall, there is a call for a streamlined two-factor authentication process using trusted methods like Google or Microsoft Authenticator, to enhance both security and user experience.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Repetitive Document Submission**: Customers are frustrated with being asked to upload documents multiple times, even when the bank already has them on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Technical Issues**: Many customers experience technical difficulties during mobile app registration and card activation, leading to a poor onboarding experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Delayed Processes**: The onboarding process is often slow, with requests stuck in the onboarding state for extended periods, causing frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Inconsistent Processes**: There is a lack of synchronization between digital and physical processes, such as signing forms and accepting terms, leading to confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Poor App Usability**: The mobile app is criticized for being difficult to use, with a focus on cross-selling rather than supporting the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Lack of Support**: Customers find it challenging to reach customer support, often getting stuck in automated systems without the option to speak to a real person.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Uninformed Relationship Managers**: Relationship managers are perceived as uninformed and lacking the authority to assist effectively, adding to customer frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Overall Disappointment**: The overall onboarding experience is seen as outdated and inefficient, leading customers to reconsider their relationship with the bank.\n",

      "Result: Feedback about customer loyalty programs highlights several issues. Customers express dissatisfaction with the transparency and fulfillment of rewards and offers. There are complaints about the lack of clarity in tracking rewards earned, with some users comparing it unfavorably to other programs like Dubai First. Additionally, customers report that promised rewards, such as cashback or vouchers, are not being honored even when spending criteria are met. Communication regarding these offers is also criticized, as follow-ups often result in unhelpful automated responses. Overall, the loyalty programs are perceived as unreliable and frustrating, with some customers feeling misled by unfulfilled promises.\n",

      "Result: The feedback on multi-factor authentication highlights several concerns and suggestions for improvement. Users find the current security measures to be excessive and cumbersome, with too many steps required for login, such as needing a password, SMS OTP, and email OTP. This three-step process is particularly inconvenient when traveling or not using a local phone number. There is a preference for simpler, more efficient security methods, such as a combination of PIN or OTP, and a desire for biometric options like fingerprint authentication. Users also express concerns about the reliability of receiving OTPs, especially via mobile, and the lack of transparency regarding certain security features like Smartpass. Overall, there is a call for a streamlined two-factor authentication process using trusted methods like Google or Microsoft Authenticator, to enhance both security and user experience.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Repetitive Document Submission**: Customers are frustrated with being asked to upload documents multiple times, even when the bank already has them on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Technical Issues**: Many customers experience technical difficulties during mobile app registration and card activation, leading to a poor onboarding experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Delayed Processes**: The onboarding process is often slow, with requests stuck in the onboarding state for extended periods, causing frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Inconsistent Processes**: There is a lack of synchronization between digital and physical processes, such as signing forms and accepting terms, leading to confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Poor App Usability**: The mobile app is criticized for being difficult to use, with a focus on cross-selling rather than supporting the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Lack of Support**: Customers find it challenging to reach customer support, often getting stuck in automated systems without the option to speak to a real person.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Uninformed Relationship Managers**: Relationship managers are perceived as uninformed and lacking the authority to assist effectively, adding to customer frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Overall Disappointment**: The overall onboarding experience is seen as outdated and inefficient, leading customers to reconsider their relationship with the bank.\n",

      "Result: Feedback about customer loyalty programs highlights several issues. Customers express dissatisfaction with the transparency and fulfillment of rewards and offers. There are complaints about the lack of clarity in tracking rewards earned, with some users comparing it unfavorably to other programs like Dubai First. Additionally, customers report that promised rewards, such as cashback or vouchers, are not being honored even when spending criteria are met. Communication regarding these offers is also criticized, as follow-ups often result in unhelpful automated responses. Overall, the loyalty programs are perceived as unreliable and frustrating, with some customers feeling misled by unfulfilled promises.\n",

      "1. **Inability to Pay Using the Mobile App**: Users are unable to make payments through the mobile banking application, which is a significant usability issue.\n",

      "2. **Lack of Integration with Digital Wallets**: There is a request for integration with Samsung Pay and Google Pay to facilitate convenient mobile payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Constant Errors**: Users experience frequent errors when making payments and transfers, leading to frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cumbersome Payment Processes**: The process of sending money is laborious, requiring extensive details and multiple steps, which is inconvenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lack of Features**: The app lacks features such as a \"pay all\" button for bills, making it time-consuming to pay each bill individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Usability Challenges**: The inability to use the card for digital purchases and the need to approve online transactions via SMS instead of through the app are seen as significant drawbacks.\n",

      "7. **Sluggish Performance**: The app operates slowly, which affects the overall payment experience.\n",
